## Description

The Dunder Mifflin Paper Company Employee Directory is an application where a user can easily and quickly access information for any Dunder Mifflin employee. The user can do a filtered search by inputting the employee name into the search bar, which will retrieve any matching results and display that employee's non-sensitive information. The Dunder Mifflin Paper Company Employee Directory also has an extensive sort functionality, which means that the user can also view the employee information by clicking on the different categories (employee name, email address, department, and branch) to view the employee information in both ascending and descending order

The Dunder Mifflin Paper Company Employee Directory utilizes React, a Javascript library, to build the application. The application also required the breakdown of the user interface into components, managing the component state, and responding to user events.
